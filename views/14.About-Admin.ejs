                or any day. In addition to the features outlined before, it has many security features that are important in an environment where access criteria to the database depend on the type of user.<br><br> The system uses verification during the
                user login to provide appropriate access to the system. Security features like user identification and authentication. The success of DataBay will reduce the weight on faculties, simplify the protocol and increase the performance of all
                the management.<br><br> DataBay is hoped to perform very well in enhancing the quality of management. Databay is developed using Node.js, Express.js for backend. HTML, CSS, EJS and React for frontend. And the database used is MongoDB.
